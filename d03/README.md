# Notes for day 3

God damn I need to separate out the code for days 1 and 2.

I don't think day 3 was particularly hard. I guess trying to figure out the adjacent numbers to gears would be pretty unintuitive at first, but I think I managed to find a solution that's reasonably clean (?) and worked on the first try, so I'm not going to touch it.

Maybe I should've made a type rather than have the word "adjacent" unpleasantly appear like 20 times in 10 lines, but that's a refactor for another day.
