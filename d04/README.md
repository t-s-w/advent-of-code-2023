# Notes on day 4

Despite my introduction to golang being "learn go with tests", I hadn't actually written my first test in Go until this challenge.

There's something to be said about how writing print statements everywhere is ugly as fuck, but we still do it anyway because the alternative is slowing ourselves down and having the discipline to write out test cases every step of the way. And then we have to put up with removing the print statements one by one.

Maybe it's to do with my start in coding as mostly scripting for personal use rather than contributing to full-fledged projects that were meant to be forked and used by other people. I feel like somewhere along the way this lack of discipline is going to bite me in the ass.

But well, until it does......................
