# Notes for day 2

I thought day 1 was supposed to be the easiest?

I cleaned up the format of my code a bit from day 1; when doing day 1 I didn't even know there'd be two parts to each day that would reuse the same things. This time I also separated the methods for getting the input and loading the environment variable (my user cookie) to make it cleaner. Working with go modules is a bit of a hassle, though, and I can't get VS Code to stop painting everything in red.
